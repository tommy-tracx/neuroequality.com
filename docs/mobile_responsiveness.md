# Mobile Responsiveness Guidelines

1. **Fluid Grid Layout**
   - Use CSS grid or flexbox with percentages and media queries to adapt to various screen sizes.
2. **Simplified Navigation**
   - Collapse the primary navigation into a hamburger menu on small screens.
   - Keep key actions (like sign up) accessible within one or two taps.
3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minify CSS and JavaScript, and defer non-critical scripts.
   - Optimize images with responsive sizes (`srcset`) and modern formats (WebP).
4. **Touch Targets**
   - Ensure buttons and links have a minimum size of 48px for comfortable tapping.
5. **Testing**
   - Test across a range of devices using browser emulators and real hardware.
6. **Accessibility**
   - Maintain contrast levels and legible typography on small screens.
   - Provide alternatives for gestures like swipe, ensuring all features are accessible via keyboard.
