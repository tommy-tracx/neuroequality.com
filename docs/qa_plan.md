# Testing and Quality Assurance Plan

## Functionality Testing
- Verify that all navigation links, forms, and interactive components work across browsers.
- Ensure user authentication, registration, and password recovery flows function correctly.

## Usability Testing
- Conduct moderated user testing sessions to gather feedback on navigation and content clarity.
- Perform accessibility audits with real screen reader users.

## Performance Testing
- Use tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest to measure load times and identify bottlenecks.
- Stress test the server to handle expected traffic using tools such as Artillery or JMeter.

## Security Testing
- Run automated vulnerability scans (e.g., OWASP ZAP).
- Implement penetration testing to validate authentication and data protection mechanisms.

## Tools & Methodologies
- **CI/CD**: Integrate tests into pipelines with GitHub Actions.
- **Issue Tracking**: Use a Kanban board to manage defects and test cases.
- **Reporting**: Generate test coverage and performance reports for each release.
